Even today, as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt, most people too often associate the Daiquiri with adult slushies, the stuff of spring break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers. But in its purest form, the Daiquiri is simple and sublime, a delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing the three. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying, though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose a too-sweet rum, and you’re sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.",

Amazingly, the drink that socialites tipped to their lips in the 19th century looks and tastes pretty much the same as the one served today at any decent cocktail bar. The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, perked up with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be.",

The origins of this classic drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake. Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing cocktail. The Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway. While the Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, the end result is a delicious, refreshing cocktail that can be enjoyed any time of the year.",

    "Name": "Amaretto Sour",
    "Description": "The Amaretto Sour gets a bad rap. Too often, it’s overly sweet and relies on premade sour mix. We enlisted Portland bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler to give us his take on the classic Amaretto Sour cocktail. What he came up with is nothing short of magic. This drink turns out frothy, sweet, sour, nutty and strong. Combining amaretto with bourbon, fresh lemon juice, rich simple syrup and egg white creates a perfectly balanced Amaretto Sour.",

    "Name": "Long island iced tea",
    "Description": "The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It’s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over. On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.",
