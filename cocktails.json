In the roughly 130 years since its inception, the granddaddy of rum cocktails has gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Señor Frog’s table tent. Even today, as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt, most people too often associate the Daiquiri with adult slushies, the stuff of spring break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers. But in its purest form, the Daiquiri is simple and sublime, a delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing the three. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying, though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose a too-sweet rum, and you’re sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.",

Amazingly, the drink that socialites tipped to their lips in the 19th century looks and tastes pretty much the same as the one served today at any decent cocktail bar. The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, perked up with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be.",

    "Description": "To many people, the Mojito represents the perfect rum cocktail. The origins of this classic drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake. Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing cocktail. The Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway. While the Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, the end result is a delicious, refreshing cocktail that can be enjoyed any time of the year.",

    "Name": "Moscow Mule",
    "Description": "The Moscow Mule practically crackles from its chill. In the dead of winter, it'll cut into the haze of your groggy, tired mind like the edge of a Siberian glacier. In the last humid dregs of summer, the frosty, copper mug will bite at your fingertips. It is a worthy use of vodka. And for all the pomp and circumstance surrounding it—the copper mug, the stirring rod—it's about as simple as a cocktail can be: spirit, mixer, and citrus. Vodka for the bitter bite, ginger beer for a sweet snap, and lime to round out the ensemble. Note that ginger ale is not equal to ginger beer, but what the hell, use in case of emergency. Then, drink your Moscow Mule while debating the extent of geopolitical meddling by our Russian comrades, or while ruminating on anything but politics. Na zdarovje.",

    "Name": "Gimlet",
    "Description": "Who says medicine can't taste amazing? This essential cocktail was created for sailors as a way to prevent scurvy. It didn't take long to realize that this preventative drink was also delicious. While scurvy may be of the past, it seems like this tart tipple is here to stay. It doesn't get much simpler or more refreshing than the classic Gimlet.",

    "Name": "Amaretto Sour",
    "Description": "The Amaretto Sour gets a bad rap. Too often, it’s overly sweet and relies on premade sour mix. We enlisted Portland bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler to give us his take on the classic Amaretto Sour cocktail. What he came up with is nothing short of magic. This drink turns out frothy, sweet, sour, nutty and strong. Combining amaretto with bourbon, fresh lemon juice, rich simple syrup and egg white creates a perfectly balanced Amaretto Sour.",
